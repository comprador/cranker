# Cranker

Avoid orchestration by reversing the polairty of your infrastructure.

## todo

* need to test sending a bunch of data
* the load balancer side and the app server side need to start independently
* we need to be able to turn the test mode on
* the app server side needs to wait
* implement HTTP proxying better
 * adding proxy header in correct circumstances
 
## where we are right now

We have both ends of cranker coded

* lb-server and cranker-server implement the load balancer end
 * start-lb starts both the servers
 * both servers need an address but default to
  * 8000 - cranker-server (websockets)
  * 8001 - load balancer proxy
* cranker-connector implements the app server side
 * it needs the app-server address ...
 * ... and the address of the cranker server
* we have a test mode that:
 * sets up a fake appserv on 8003
 * sets up cranker-connector from the appserv to a load balancer
 * fires a request at the load balancer
 * shows that the request comes back via the fake appserv
 
## how it works

* cranker/a runs near your load balancer - there should be 1 of this
 * listen to 2 sockets, x and y
 * receive connections from the load balancer on x
 * receive connections from cranker/b on y
  * these will arrive in lumps
  * when a cranker-connector starts it tries to connect a lot of sockets
* cranker/b runs near your app server
 * makes websockets to cranker/a
 * what comes over the websocket is encoded HTTP requests from the load balancer
 * proxy the request to the app server
 * return the response encoded over the websocket
